A3SGXH7AUHU8GW,delmartian,I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.,5.0

ABXLMWJIXXAIN,"Natalia Corres ""Natalia Corres""","This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.",5.0
ABXLMWJIXXAIN,"Natalia Corres ""Natalia Corres""","For speed and wholesome goodness, Annie's can never be beaten.  And since this is a basic mac & cheese in a bowl, I have found it works well with left-over ""add-ons"" like vegies or a variety of meats.  I can have a filling, ""good for you"" meal in less than 5 minutes.  And kids love it too!",5.0
ABXLMWJIXXAIN,"Natalia Corres ""Natalia Corres""","We sent this product as a gift to my husband's daughter (who just graduated from UNH and started her new job in research).  She was delighted with the sentiment and the gluten free snacks!<br />When we ordered it, there was no place to put a gift greeting, so we contacted the company, and they added the greeting for us and were very sweet and courteous - we loved the customer service and the products.<br />We highly recommend this company and their products, delicious healthy snacks with great service.  What more could you ask for?",5.0

A395BORC6FGVXV,Karl,If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.,3.0

ADT0SRK1MGOEU,Twoapennything,"I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.",4.0

A1SP2KVKFXXRU1,David C. Sullivan,"This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!",5.0

A21BT40VZCCYT4,Carol A. Reed,This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.,5.0
